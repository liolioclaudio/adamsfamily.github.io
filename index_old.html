				Social media platforms have taken a great importance in our modern society. Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn have become very powerful tools to spread a message. They allow a direct connection between parties or companies and citizens, and recent events such as the Arab Spring have shown they can be used as a driving force. However, in such media which favor free expression, the control is weak or inexistant and thus fake information can spread quickly, against the social good.
				<br> As an example, we can quote the US elections of 2016, where Trump became the 45th US president, where all the surveys predicted the victory of the democrat candidate, Hillary Clinton. How could it happen?
				<br> Some hypothesis might say that the <abbr title="Internet Research Agency">IRA</abbr>, which may have lead a disinformation campaign against Hillary Clinton. The <abbr title="Internet Research Agency">IRA</abbr> is a Russian compagny specialized in online propaganda to serve Russian interests.
				<br> Our goal will be to see through a set of tweets if indeed the IRA has played a role during the elections, and if the tweets had an impact on the voting intentions.
