										Against all voters survey, Donald Trump becomes the 45th US president. How could it happen ?
										<br> <br>
										We live in a society where social media platforms have taken a great importance. Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn have become very powerful tools to spread a message. They allow a direct connection between parties or companies and citizens, and recent events such as the Arab Spring have shown they can be used as a driving force. However, in such media which favor free expression, the control is weak or inexistant and thus fake information can spread quickly, against the social good. <br>
